\chapter{Introduction}
\Gls{consciousness} remains an elusive concept despite extensive scrutiny
from many traditions \autocite{sep-consciousness}. Philosophy of mind,
neuroscience, psychology and - recently - computer science have been
prodding the concept from a plenitude of angles.
\footnote{The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers an overview of
many of the disciplines and approaches involved in the quest to explain
\gls{consciousness} so far \autocite{sep-consciousness}.}
This endeavour is paramount to understanding the human condition, but
raises unavoidable and highly intricate existential questions
\autocite{amodei2016, soares2016}.


Since the 19th century developments within neuroscience are rapidly
increasing our understanding of the cognitive processes that partake in
the construction of \gls{consciousness} \autocite{atkinson2000}.\footnote{
Some philosophers require consciousness
to include metaphysical properties \autocite{sep-consciousness} (dualism).
This essay eludes the question by
focusing on falsifiable and positivistic theories, in the hope that
they can bring us closer to the truth - whether that entails dualism
or reductionism.}

The advances and sheer amount of details neuroscience and neuroimaging
techniques led \textcite{atkinson2000} to call for more detailed theories
that identifies \textit{neural correlates of consciousness (\gls{ncc})}
\autocite{atkinson2000}. That call was answered by a plethora of theories
that attempted to infer frameworks, on which novel understandings of
consciousness could be based.\footnote{There are far too many papers
to list in this essay, but to just mention a few influential papers, see 
\cite{baars2005, block2007, crick2003, damasio2003, dehaene2001, kouider2010, Tononi2004, zeki2008, sep-consciousness, schmidhuber2014, Nilsson2009}.
}

Simultaneously to the advances in neuroscience, \gls{computation}al theory
increased its efforts within \gls{AI} (AI) \autocite{Nilsson2009}, and
matured to a point where many of the neurophysiological properties can be
replicated in silicon \autocite{Tononi2004, schmidhuber2014}.\footnote{Other
technologies show promising advances in forming computational substrates such
as  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing}{molecular biology}
and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing}{quantum computing},
but have yet to reach the complexity of digital electronic computers.}


\autocite{dennett2017}.

consciousness will exclusively relate to the \textit{hard} problem of inner experience as

\section{Vectors and dimensionality}

\section{Alternative approaches}
Common for each contribution is a fundamental desire to deepen the
understanding of both consciousness as a concept, and the principles
partaking in the creation of the concept. 
Guided by years of academic training and tradition, each discipline have
approached this \gls{top-down} by, in abstract terms, describing 
or \gls{bottom-up} \autocite{sep-consciousness},
: either constructing abstract
frameworks \autocite{block2007,kouider2010} or 

\gls{top-down} \textit{and} \gls{bottom-up} \autocite{dehaene2001, baars2005}
